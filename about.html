      MISSING serves as a digital extension of the themes explored in Chase
      Coury's book of the same name, which features a collection of missing
      posters alongside curated texts that examine absence and the feeling of
      incompleteness. Users can visually engage with concepts of loss and
      identity, with a particular emphasis on the poetic elements that
      complement the imagery. The platform invites exploration and
      interpretation, allowing users to reflect on the complexities of being
      missing in both a literal and metaphorical sense. Through this interactive
      experience, the website aims to foster a deeper understanding of the
      nuanced relationships between absence, memory, and selfhood.
