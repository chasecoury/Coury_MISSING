          In the middle of the road of my life I awoke in a dark wood where the
          true way was wholly lost... I cannot rightly say how I entered it. I
          was so full of sleep, at the point where I abandoned the true way
        </div>
        <div class="line" draggable="true">
          To be lost is nothing to fear, for everything that is lost is on the
          path to being found
        </div>
        <div class="line" draggable="true">
          Only when we are lost can we actually find something

        <div class="line" draggable="true">
          You are not the only one who feels this way, who walks with tender
          steps, too afraid to be led down a path that will take you farther
          from home
        </div>
        <div class="line" draggable="true">
          For the longest time, I loathed the feeling of being lost in life. I
          mean, who doesn’t

        <div class="line" draggable="true">
          No two trees are the same to Raven. No two branches are the same to
          Wren. If what a tree or a bush does is lost on you, you are surely
          lost

          Now that you’re gone, there is an emptiness that surrounds my space,
          my thoughts

          As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle
          dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease
        </div>
        <div class="line" draggable="true">
          Accept, then act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as
          if you have chosen it

          Your outer journey may contain a million steps; your inner journey
          only has one: the step you are taking right now

        <div class="line" draggable="true">
          Being lost ushers you more fully into the now. We are often so busy
          trying to get into an imagined future that we’ve lost the present
          moment

        <div class="line" draggable="true">
          All I can do is remind you of what you have forgotten

          It is not uncommon for people to spend their whole life waiting to
          start living

          I could still function in the world, although I realized that nothing
          I ever did could possibly add anything to what I already had

          So, begin to trust that place of not knowing. Surrender to it. A death
          is happening. There will be grief. But gradually, in the rebirth of
          life, a new way emerges
        </div>
        <div class="line" draggable="true">
          Each time I found myself sinking, each time I found myself in that
          liminal space that comes between the death of an old way of living
          that no longer serves me and the resurrection of new life, I’ve
          started to realize that that feeling lost in life isn’t something to
          be afraid of

        <div class="line" draggable="true">
          I am but one in this atmosphere. One smile. One body on these legs.
          One heart beating furiously in my chest

          A belief may be comforting. Only through your own experience, however,
          does it become liberating
